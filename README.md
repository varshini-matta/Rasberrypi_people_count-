People count and identification using integration of YOLO V8 and Raspberry PI
In the realm of surveillance and crowd management, people tracking is a major problem. This research describes about people counting and identification in real world scenarios and also <br> movement of vehicles in traffic, number of cars moving in and out in parking area. This pioneers the innovative integration of YOLOv8 with Raspberry Pi 4B, revolutionizing people counting and identification systems.<br> By optimizing YOLOv8's architecture and training methodologies, the approach achieves real-time person detection and recognition. Meticulous dataset curation, model refinement, and evaluation techniques ensure <br> accurate individual counting and identification, signifying its potential for security surveillance and crowd management. The research highlights YOLOv8's adaptability and efficacy in diverse settings, <br> particularly when integrated with Raspberry Pi 4B.
